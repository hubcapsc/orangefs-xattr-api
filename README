Makefile.am thinks (on a couple of lines)
that orangefs is installed in /opt/trunk...
change that as needed.

Run prepare.sh

Then configure

Then make

Works like this:

  ./srv get /pvfsmnt/testfile key
  ./srv del /pvfsmnt/testfile key
  ./srv set /pvfsmnt/testfile key value
  ./srv enum /pvfsmnt/testfile
